# eYSIP_2015_Attendance_System_using_Face_Recognition

This project is a part of e-Yantra Summer Internship program, 2015. The project is undertaken by Syed Yousuff and Kunal Mehta 
under the guidance of Mr.Viral and Mr.Yamik. The end goal of this project is to build an automatic logging system using image 
processing for face recognition. The cameras placed at the entrance and exit of the lab will be triggered by a PIR motion sensor 
that will capture the image of a person entering or leaving the lab. Facial recognition on the images will be applied and the 
identity of the person will be extracted from the images. This data will be automatically logged. The system will also
include a GUI application that will monitor the system and also help in viewing the logs.

About the repository: The repository contains separate folders for each day's work. All the programs written and tested on a 
particular day can be found under the respective folders. There is also a detailed documentation for each level of the project.
